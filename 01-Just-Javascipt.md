# Lesson 1 - JavaScript Code

Some javascript concepts are really necessary in order to learn more about react. We'll be making use of these specific javascript functions over and over. The list of the functions is provided below:

1. `fetch()` function
2. Array functions
   - `.map()` function
   - `.filter()` function
   - `.push()` function
   - `.concat()` function

If any more functions need to be taught, they will be added accordingly.
